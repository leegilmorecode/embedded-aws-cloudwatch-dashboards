## Introduction

In this article, we delve deeper into the topic by demonstrating the creation of custom AWS CDK L3 Constructs with integrated CloudWatch Dashboards. This example illustrates how embedding these dashboards as a standard feature within your custom constructs can enhance the user experience and streamline the workflow for all consumers, alleviating the cognitive burden on engineering teams.
